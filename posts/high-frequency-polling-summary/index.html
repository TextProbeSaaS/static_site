    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This study explores the potential of online surveys, even those with skewed demographics, to accurately measure public opinion. The authors demonstrate their method by analyzing an Xbox poll of US voters in the 2012 election. By applying statistical adjustments, their estimates align closely with actual results, suggesting non-representative polls can be surprisingly accurate, offering advantages like speed, cost, and real-time tracking of public sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The paper is about using non-representative polling, such as opt-in online surveys, to accurately and continuously track public opinion, with proper statistical adjustment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authors demonstrate their approach by estimating support for presidential candidates from an opt-in sample gathered on the Xbox gaming system, which is highly skewed in gender and age compared to the voting population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authors use multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to correct for the sample bias and generate estimates of voter intent at the national, state, and demographic subgroup levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authors show that their MRP-adjusted estimates are in line with those from traditional polls and the final election outcome, and that they can capture the dynamics of public opinion in response to events such as the presidential debates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authors argue that non-representative polling offers the promise of fast, cheap, and accurate assessments of public opinion, and discuss some practical challenges and opportunities for this approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
