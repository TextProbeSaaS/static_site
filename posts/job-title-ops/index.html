    <h4 id="what-is-devops">What is DevOps</h4>
<p>In the current market, various operations (ops) positions are available, but the most prevalent one, especially with the rise of Agile, is DevOps. Originally defined as &ldquo;Developers Do Operations,&rdquo; this concept is reflected in tools like Terraform and Bicep. These tools aim to eliminate handoffs and anti-patterns by allowing developers to use templates and budgets, enabling them to create what they need without dependencies on elements Agile seeks to remove. The term has evolved, as seen on the Subreddit DevOps, where it is humorously referred to as a way to earn more money than being called a SysAdmin.</p>
<p>The loss of a clear definition for DevOps is attributed to marketing, which often focuses on lift-and-shift strategies rather than embracing cloud-native approaches.</p>
<h2 id="reassessing-ops-roles">Reassessing Ops Roles</h2>
<p>While DevOps, combining Infrastructure and SysAdmin responsibilities, remains crucial due to the hybrid nature of contemporary systems, many other traditional Ops positions may no longer be relevant. Data Analysts/Scientists handling DataOps or Machine Learning engineers managing MLOps have shifted towards low or no-code solutions. In cases of self-hosting, the skills of a DevOps role are still necessary, particularly in networking and associated SystemAdmin tasks.</p>
<h3 id="rethinking-the-role-of-ops">Rethinking the Role of Ops</h3>
<p>Several models propose different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DevOps Ownership</strong>: Martin Fowler&rsquo;s idea of developers owning ops has been largely overlooked, where software engineers are expected to manage the entire lifecycle and instrumentation of their applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embedded DevOps</strong>: Each product team or squad has dedicated infrastructure specialists working exclusively on their product or a specific part of a larger product. Larger organizations may supplement this with a &ldquo;DevOps expertise center&rdquo; team defining best practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevOps as &ldquo;Infra Silo&rdquo;</strong>: Similar to other silos, each project involves frontend, backend, and infrastructure work. This model, often used in consultancies, creates a shared pool of resources. While cost-efficient, it can be ineffective in terms of quality and speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevOps as &ldquo;Platform Team&rdquo;</strong>: This model focuses on building tools for other engineering teams to self-serve rather than directly solving infrastructure problems. Although scalable, it requires a significant upfront investment and long-term planning. Engineers on other teams are expected to have some infrastructure knowledge, similar to the embedded model, with the platform team serving as the expertise center.</p>
